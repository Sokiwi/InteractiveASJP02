# InteractiveASJP02

Interactive R program for calculating LDND, LDN, dates, and homelands, and for manipulating different versions of the database and transcribing and editing one's own ASJP-style database.

    Create an empty folder and put all the files shared here in it.
    Within R, change the working directory to the one where you put the files.
    In the R console, write source("ASJP.R")
    Now type ASJP() and press return.

These instructions, with the inclusion of a bit more detail, are also in INSTRUCTIONS.txt.
